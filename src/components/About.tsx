            My current stack includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, and testing frameworks like Selenium, JUnit, and Cypress. I also build mobile experiences with Flutter and Firebase. I've worked across freelance gigs, startups, and agile teams—always with a curiosity to learn and improve.

            Outside of tech, I love anime, music festivals, and wandering new cities with a camera in hand. I bring the same curiosity and creative spark to every project I join.
